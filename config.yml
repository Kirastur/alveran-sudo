#
# Welcome to the Alveran configuration settings
#
# Please contact us at discord if you have any questions
#   https://discord.gg/MBJjqUHQHR
#
#
# The main purpose of this plugin is that a player
# can accquire temporary permission by his own (like Linux "sudo")
# Very useful in conjunction with LuckPerms "auto-op"
#
# Usage:
#   simply execute "/alveran" as a player or from a command block
#
# If called as a user, the user must have "alveran.use" permission
# to be allowed to execute this command
#
# The API can be used to call Avleran from other plugins
# Get the API object with: 
#   AlveranAPI alveranAPI = AlveranProvider.getAPI();
#
#
# This plugin depends on LuckPerms and WorldGuard
#
# There is no auto-update for this plugin
#


general:
  # Name of the world
  #
  # - Select which world is affected
  # - "world" is the default name if you set up a new server
  # - Alveran does only support a single world
  # - Alveran is not tested with multiverse
  world: world
  
  # If Alvaran should exposes its API to other plugins
  #
  # - If enabled, other Plugins can get an API object by using
  # -  "AlveranAPI alveranAPI = AlveranProvider.getAPI();"
  enable-api: true

  # If the "alveran" command can be executed by players
  #
  # - If not, only Console/RCON and command blocks can execute
  # - The main purpose of Alveran is to be called by command blocks
  player-can-execute-command: false
  
  # Enable debug
  #
  # Debug will bring you additional output on the console
  debug: false
  

# Authentication (Protection)
#
# - We have a two-factor-authentication here
# - 1. Conscious decision (Player must stay in a specific region)
# - 2. Authorization (Player must have permission)
protection:

  # WorldGuard Region
  #
  # - The player must stay in a specific region to get blessed
  # - If more than one player with the appropriate permission stay
  # -  inside this region, all of them are blessed
  # - The Region must be defined in WorldGuard
  # - The flags of the region do not matter (e.g. passthrough)   
  region: alveran
  
  # Permission
  #
  # - Only players having this permission can be blessed
  # - Permission check is done by LuckPerms, so this plugin is mandantory
  # - The permission name is hard coded in plugin.yml
  # - so please change it here only if you know what you are doing
  permission: alveran.acolyte


# Action (Perform blessing)
#
# - Define how the blessing looks like
# - In general, a blessing is the temporary adding of a permission group
# -  to one or more players fulfilling the above criteria
action:

  # Destination Group
  #
  # - The name of the group which is temporary added to the players
  # - This group must already exists in LuckPerms
  # - It is added as a temporary group
  # - When the timer expires LuckPerms will remove membership automatically
  destination-group: alveran
  
  # Blessing duration
  #
  # - Define how log the player should be member of the the group
  # - Please enter an integer
  # - For Re-Blessing see LuckPerms config option "temporary-add-behaviour"
  # - Blessing is automatically removed if the player leaves the server
  blessing-duration-hours: 24
  
  # Player logout behaviour
  #
  # - Select what happens if the player is logging out
  # - If enabled on every login and logout Alveran checks membership
  # -  and removes the group from the player, regardless of the timer
  unbless-on-leave: true
  
  # Notify player about blessing timeout
  #
  # - Specify if the player should get noticed
  # -  when the blessing has reached its lifetime
  # -  and LuckPerms has removed the group from the player
  # -  (or the blessing was removed manually by a LuckPerm command)
  # -
  # - The bless and optional unbless whisper to the player are sent
  # -  regardless if the groupmembership was changed by Alveran 
  # -  or manually by a LuckPerms command or API call
  # -  so you can only use the notification part of Alveran
  # -  without using the command
  notify-on-unbless: true  

  
# Messages sent to the player
#
# - Please translate them in your language
# - Use locale to select language
# -  replace "_" char with "-"
messages:

  # This is the default language if locale not fond
  default:

    # This is whispered to the player after he has received the blessing
    blessed: You have received the blessing of Alveran
    
    # This is whispered to the player when the blessing has times out
    faded: The blessing of Alveran is fading away
  
    # This is send to the player if he tries to execute the alveran command
    # and "player-can-execute-command" is set to false
    executed-as-player: You cannot use this command as a player
  
# Locale example for germany
#  de-de:
#    blessed: Du hast den Segen von Alveran erhalten
#    faded: Der Segen von Alveran verbla√üt
#    executed-as-player: Dieses Kommando darfst Du als Spieler nicht benutzen
